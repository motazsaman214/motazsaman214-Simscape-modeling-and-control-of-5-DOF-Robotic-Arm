# 5-DOF Robotic Arm: CAD to System Dynamics and Control 
This repository demonstrates the process of modeling, simulating, and controlling a 5-Degree-of-Freedom (DOF) robotic arm using Simscape Multibody and the Peter Corke Robotics Toolbox. The project guides users through transitioning from a CAD model to a complete system dynamics and control framework, showcasing tools for multibody dynamics and robotic control.
